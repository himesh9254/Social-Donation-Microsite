# PayPal SDK Fix Guide

## Issue Analysis

The PayPal JS SDK script is failing to load due to the following issues:

1. **Missing Environment Variables**: No `.env.local` file exists
2. **Hardcoded Client ID**: The component was using a hardcoded, potentially invalid client ID
3. **Missing NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix**: Environment variables need the `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix to be accessible in the browser

## ‚úÖ What Was Fixed

1. **Removed hardcoded PayPal Client ID** - Now uses environment variables
2. **Added proper error handling** - Shows a warning when PayPal is not configured
3. **Fixed TypeScript errors** - Removed unsupported props from PayPal components
4. **Added debugging information** - Console logs help identify configuration issues
5. **Preserved UI/UX** - The form still works with direct processing when PayPal is unavailable

## üîß Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Create Environment File

1. Create a new file called `.env.local` in the `donations-microsite` folder
2. Add your PayPal credentials:

```env
# PayPal Configuration
PAYPAL_MODE=sandbox
PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=your_paypal_client_id_here
PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET=your_paypal_client_secret_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=your_paypal_client_id_here

# Admin password for CMS access
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_secure_password_here

# Optional: Email and AI settings
EMAIL_USER=your_gmail@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_gmail_app_password
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
```

### Step 2: Get PayPal Credentials

1. Go to [PayPal Developer Dashboard](https://developer.paypal.com/dashboard/)
2. Login with your PayPal account
3. Navigate to **Apps & Credentials**
4. Create a new app or use the default app
5. Copy your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**

**Important**: Use the same Client ID for both `PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID`

### Step 3: Restart Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

## üîç Testing the Fix

### Check Console Messages

Open your browser's developer console and look for:

- ‚úÖ **"PayPal Client ID: Available"** - Environment variable is loaded
- ‚úÖ **"Environment variables loaded: true"** - Configuration is working
- ‚ùå **"PayPal Client ID: Missing"** - Need to set up environment variables
- ‚ùå **"PayPal is not configured"** - Shows warning in UI

### Test PayPal Integration

1. Fill out the donation form
2. Click "Continue to Payment"
3. Check for:
   - PayPal buttons appear (if configured)
   - Warning message (if not configured)
   - Console logs for debugging information

## üö® Troubleshooting

### PayPal SDK Still Fails to Load

1. **Check Environment Variables**:
   ```bash
   # In your .env.local file, ensure:
   NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=your_actual_client_id
   ```

2. **Verify Client ID**:
   - Go to PayPal Developer Dashboard
   - Check if your app is active
   - Ensure you're using the correct Client ID

3. **Check Network Requests**:
   - Open DevTools ‚Üí Network tab
   - Look for requests to `https://www.paypal.com/sdk/js`
   - Check the response status and body

4. **Domain Verification**:
   - Ensure your domain is registered in PayPal Developer Dashboard
   - For localhost, this should work automatically

### Common Error Messages

- **"Failed to load the PayPal JS SDK script"**: Missing or invalid Client ID
- **"Invalid client ID"**: Check your PayPal Developer Dashboard
- **"CORS error"**: Domain not registered with PayPal

## üîÑ Current Behavior

- **With Environment Variables**: PayPal buttons will load and work properly
- **Without Environment Variables**: Shows a warning message and falls back to direct processing
- **Network Issues**: Console will show detailed error information for debugging

## üìù Environment Variable Details

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID`: Required for frontend PayPal SDK (visible to browser)
- `PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID`: Used for server-side API calls
- `PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET`: Used for server-side API calls
- `PAYPAL_MODE`: Set to "sandbox" for testing or "live" for production

## üéØ Next Steps

After setting up the environment variables:

1. Test the PayPal integration
2. Verify payments work in sandbox mode
3. Set up production credentials when ready
4. Configure email notifications
5. Test the complete donation flow

## üìû Support

If you're still experiencing issues:

1. Check the browser console for error messages
2. Verify your PayPal credentials are correct
3. Ensure your domain is properly configured
4. Test with a fresh PayPal sandbox account
